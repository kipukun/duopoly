# duopoly
monopoly plus is a monopoly game for PC that unfortunately only supports a single controller, so you have to pass it around to your friends.
this mod fixes that by combining all controllers into one, allowing you to use multiple controllers

this is a "dumb" mod in that it doesn't know which player is which controller, so all controllers can always input. so just don't touch anything on your
friends turn

# setup

1. download the release zip, and put the contents in your monopoly plus folder (dll_injector32.exe and duopoly.dll)
2. run `.\dllinjector32.exe /dll "duopoly.dll" /target "Monopoly.exe"`

you can setup a shortcut for the above command so you can just click-n-go

# bugs
this mod doesn't support the analog sticks or trigger buttons. monopoly plus doesn't use these buttons, so it's not a big deal
